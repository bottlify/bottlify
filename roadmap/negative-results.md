# Negative results

Ideas that were measured and did not pay. The file is appended to and never rewritten: a later
measurement of the same idea is a new, dated entry with its own conditions, because a result can
depend on the browser, the driver and the machine, and a no today is not a no for ever.

Each entry gives, and writes `not recorded` for what was not saved rather than reconstructing it:

- the date, the workload and the bundle's hash;
- the baseline and the candidate, every raw value, how many runs, the median and the spread, and
  the noise floor of the campaign;
- the browser, the GPU and driver, the operating system and the power plan;
- what was checked for correctness beside the speed;
- the decision: removed, off by default, or left.

A measurement later found wrong goes under **Invalidated**, with the reason, and is not used as
evidence again.

## Entries

### 2026-10-05 -- the system's side of a link waits blocking while calls are recent

- **Idea.** A process in a worker of its own waits 200-500 us for each answer from the engine
  thread that comes after a pause, while the answer itself takes about 12 us. The guess was that
  `Atomics.waitAsync`, on which the engine thread sleeps, wakes slowly, and that blocking on the
  doorbell with `Atomics.wait` (1 ms at a time, the event loop given a turn between) for 50 ms after
  the last call would wake faster.
- **Workload.** A scratch benchmark, not a bundle: one worker calls the engine thread through
  `system/link.js` 300 times, 2 ms of busy work between calls, the handler returning a number.
  Bundle hash: not applicable.
- **Values.** One run each. `waitAsync` (baseline): median 181 us, p90 271 us. Blocking wait
  (candidate): median 196 us, p90 317 us. Spread and noise floor: not recorded.
- **Machine.** Node 22.22.0, a 4-core Linux VM (Firecracker). No browser, no GPU. Power plan: not
  recorded.
- **Why it did not pay.** What costs is waking a sleeping thread in this VM, about 100 us each way,
  whichever call it sleeps in.
- **Correctness.** Not checked; the candidate never left the scratch benchmark.
- **Decision.** Removed. Instead, the calls were taken off the link: the volume's reads are kept
  per drive revision, and opens are settled in shared memory.

### 2026-10-07 -- a second executor for Doom 3 and Tron

- **Idea.** Stage 3 of roadmap v2: a process whose threads are ready at the same time runs them on
  two executors. It pays only where two or more of a program's threads are ready for much of the
  time.
- **Workload.** `doom-3-demo` (bundle sha256 `1b34af89...`, `Doom3.exe`, to its menu, and again
  with `+map game/demo_mars_city1`, whether the map loaded not confirmed) and `tron-demo` (`fd154abf...`, `Lithtech.exe` with the
  manifest's command line), each in node through `tools/launch-probe.mjs --series` with
  `--no-raster`, cork at `cork2` f39364f2 with the counters of 540762f9. The scheduler's
  `parallel` counts every slice's host time by how many threads could have run during it.
- **Values.** One run per scenario, rows every 2-3 s. Share of slice time with two or more threads
  ready: Doom 3 to the menu 0-4 % per row (main thread 100 % busy, its other two threads blocked
  nearly throughout); Doom 3 with the map 0-9 % while loading, 1-2 % after; Tron 0-3 %, 1 % after
  loading. Spread across runs and the noise floor: not recorded.
- **Machine.** Node 22.22.0, a 4-core x86-64 Linux VM. No browser, no GPU. Power plan: not
  recorded.
- **Why it would not pay.** With at most a few percent of the time spent with two threads ready,
  Amdahl's law gives a second executor almost nothing, and the atomic variant's tax (not yet
  measured) would make the one busy thread slower.
- **Correctness.** Not applicable: nothing was built, only counted.
- **Decision.** Stage 3 is not started for these titles. The counters stay, so that a title with
  more parallel threads shows it.

## Invalidated

None yet.

### 2026-10-07 -- several translation workers for one process, on four cores

- **Idea.** Roadmap v2, stage 2: while a game loads, its one translation worker is busy most of
  the time with work queued behind its batch, so two or three workers, each with a batch of its
  own out and one cache arena between them, would load it sooner.
- **Workload.** `doom-3-demo` (`Doom3.exe`, the manifest's command line) and `tron-demo`
  (`Lithtech.exe`, the manifest's command line), each started cold in node with an empty
  in-memory translation store, `cork.config` `{ feed: 'slice', timings: true, worker: true,
  translators: N }`, `graphics.raster` false, 40 s; the mark is the second at which the guest had
  retired 4.85 G instructions (Doom 3, the end of its loading) or 2.8 G (Tron). `cork2` at
  `4ef1b2f1` (the arena, and the check that a candidate a batch out holds is not formed again;
  the translation worker was reworked to serve ports while the rounds ran, its own scope's
  messages handled as before); N = 1, 2, 3 in turn, three rounds.
- **Values.** Seconds to the mark, three runs each, median in brackets. Doom 3: N=1 14, 16, 18
  (16); N=2 16, 20, 18 (18); N=3 17, 21, 18 (18). Tron: N=1 25, 27, 27 (27); N=2 29, 27, 30 (29);
  N=3 30, 30, 34 (30). The regions published were alike (Doom 3 5440-5827, Tron 4506-5713), but
  the workers' emitting per region grew: Doom 3 1.97-2.57 ms with one, 3.18-3.80 with two,
  3.81-4.94 with three; Tron 1.74-2.14, 2.41-3.46, 3.08-3.97. Cores in use by the whole process,
  sampled each second over a 25 s Doom 3 run, one run each: 2.5-3.6 with one translator while
  loading, 3.3-3.8 with two. The same emitting with no engine, in 1-4 threads at once (the bench
  programs' regions, 12 rounds): 3.20, 6.65, 7.65 and 7.30 rounds a second in all. Noise floor:
  not recorded; the first round without the arena ran 15-23 s for Doom 3 with one translator.
- **Machine.** Node 22.22.0, a 4-core x86-64 Linux VM (Firecracker). No browser, no GPU. Power
  plan: not recorded.
- **Why it did not pay.** On four cores one translator already leaves no core free while a game
  loads: the engine thread, the translator and V8's own threads (compiling the program's modules,
  collecting) take 2.5-3.6 of them. A second translator runs on a core it takes from them, and
  every region costs it more. In isolation two emitters run twice as fast as one.
- **Correctness.** The gates of `translators.test.js` and `arena.test.js` pass.
- **Decision.** Kept, for machines with cores to spare: the pool lends a process more workers
  only where the median rule says they are busy and a check of the yield after each join says the
  process's translation went faster -- on this machine, a joined worker leaves again.
