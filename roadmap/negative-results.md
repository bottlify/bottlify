# Negative results

Ideas that were measured and did not pay. The file is appended to and never rewritten: a later
measurement of the same idea is a new, dated entry with its own conditions, because a result can
depend on the browser, the driver and the machine, and a no today is not a no for ever.

Each entry gives, and writes `not recorded` for what was not saved rather than reconstructing it:

- the date, the workload and the bundle's hash;
- the baseline and the candidate, every raw value, how many runs, the median and the spread, and
  the noise floor of the campaign;
- the browser, the GPU and driver, the operating system and the power plan;
- what was checked for correctness beside the speed;
- the decision: removed, off by default, or left.

A measurement later found wrong goes under **Invalidated**, with the reason, and is not used as
evidence again.

### 2026-10-05 -- the system's side of a link waits blocking while calls are recent

- **Idea.** A process in a worker of its own waits 200-500 us for each answer from the engine
  thread that comes after a pause, while the answer itself takes about 12 us. The guess was that
  `Atomics.waitAsync`, on which the engine thread sleeps, wakes slowly, and that blocking on the
  doorbell with `Atomics.wait` (1 ms at a time, the event loop given a turn between) for 50 ms after
  the last call would wake faster.
- **Workload.** A scratch benchmark, not a bundle: one worker calls the engine thread through
  `system/link.js` 300 times, 2 ms of busy work between calls, the handler returning a number.
  Bundle hash: not applicable.
- **Values.** One run each. `waitAsync` (baseline): median 181 us, p90 271 us. Blocking wait
  (candidate): median 196 us, p90 317 us. Spread and noise floor: not recorded.
- **Machine.** Node 22.22.0, a 4-core Linux VM (Firecracker). No browser, no GPU. Power plan: not
  recorded.
- **Why it did not pay.** What costs is waking a sleeping thread in this VM, about 100 us each way,
  whichever call it sleeps in.
- **Correctness.** Not checked; the candidate never left the scratch benchmark.
- **Decision.** Removed. Instead, the calls were taken off the link: the volume's reads are kept
  per drive revision, and opens are settled in shared memory.
