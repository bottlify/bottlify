# 12 — Decisions we made, and where we could go faster

Two registers in one file, both of them things a reader should be able to find without reading the
code that implements them.

**Part A** is behaviour this project *decided* rather than established. It exists because Bottlify is
under no obligation to match any particular reimplementation of Windows: what a program observes is
the contract, and where no published expectation could be found, or where a different answer serves
this engine better, that is a choice to be defended on its merits and revisited when something
argues against it. Each entry says what the status actually is — verified, recalled, decided, or
never run.

**Part B** is where the implementation that is correct is knowingly the slow one. Performance is part
of correctness here, so these are debts rather than wishes.

Nothing in either list is a bug report. A bug goes in the code and gets fixed.

---

## A. Decided rather than established

### A1. DirectDraw refuses a 15- or 24-bit display mode

`SetDisplayMode` answers `DDERR_INVALIDMODE` for 15 and 24 bits per pixel. **Status: decided.**

There is no published expectation to check this against — the conformance corpus never calls it with
15, and its single 24-bit call is a fallback inside the tests' own helper with no assertion on the
result. The reference implementation forwards any of 8/15/16/24/32 to the mode set and lets that
succeed or fail. We refuse, because this layer has no such surface format to create and
`DDERR_INVALIDMODE` is the code DirectDraw uses for a mode it cannot set.

Revisit if a program is found that asks for one of these and treats the refusal as fatal. Supporting
24-bit properly means a three-byte pixel path through the blitter and the presenter, which is real
work for a format almost nothing chose.

### A2. This build announces itself as hardware, with transform and lighting

**Status: decided, with reasons, at the start of Direct3D 7 (master plan §3).** Until that step
`GetCaps` claimed no 3D and filled the hardware and emulation blocks identically; that changes with
it.

The decision: the hardware block reports 3D and the surface kinds a 3D device needs, the emulation
block reports the blitting and GDI capabilities only, and device enumeration names three devices in
the order a machine with a transform-and-lighting card lists them — software rasteriser, hardware
device, and hardware device with transform and lighting. All three are the same renderer
underneath; only the descriptions differ.

Why: there is a real GPU underneath, so the hardware claim is the true one — and programs of this
era branch on it. They look for the hardware device, prefer the transform-and-lighting one, and read
an emulation-only enumeration as "no accelerator", which sends them into software rendering or into
refusing to run. Announcing the capabilities we actually have, under the identifiers programs check,
is the generic contract and not a concession to any title.

The thing to watch: a capability bit set here is a promise about what draws correctly. Every bit
claimed is one a program may take a path on, so this list should grow as the renderer does and not
before.

### A3. The 64-bit arithmetic helpers pop their own arguments

`_allmul`, `_alldiv`, `_allrem`, `_aulldiv` and `_aullrem` in ntdll are declared stdcall with
sixteen argument bytes — the callee cleans up. **Status: decided against a published specification,
on evidence.**

The reference project's export specification declares them cdecl. Its own C implementation declares
them `WINAPI`, which is stdcall, and the compiler that generates these calls emits four pushes with
no stack adjustment afterwards. Two of the three sources agree with each other and with the call
site, so the specification file is the one we do not believe. If this is ever wrong, the symptom is
a caller whose stack is sixteen bytes off with nothing pointing at the cause — so if these are ever
suspected, remove all five rather than adjusting them; they are normally linked statically and
nothing else depends on them being present.

### A4. Three shift helpers are absent on purpose

`_allshl`, `_allshr` and `_aullshr` are not exported. They take their operand in EDX:EAX and their
count in CL, and the trap stub writes EAX and DX before any handler runs, so there is nothing left
to shift. An unresolved import that names the function is better than a shift of whatever the stub
left behind.

**This is the one entry here with a known fix**: a stub variant that saves EAX and EDX before the
trap, the way the existing result-preserving flag already saves EAX into ECX. Worth doing if a
program actually imports them.

### A5. ntdll's timer resolution is a plausible number, not a measured one

`SYSTEM_BASIC_INFORMATION`'s timer resolution is 156250 (15.625 ms). **Status: never measured** —
this engine has no timer interrupt to measure with. Every other field of that structure is a real
fact about this machine. Revisit when there is a periodic interrupt to time.

### A6. Ansi-to-Unicode conversion in ntdll ignores the code page

`RtlAnsiStringToUnicodeString` widens byte for byte. Correct for ASCII, wrong above 0x7f for
anything but Latin-1. `kernel32/locale.js` has a real single-byte decoder that is not exported;
threading it through is a small piece of work nobody has needed yet.

### A7. Only three information classes are answered

`NtQuerySystemInformation` answers `SystemBasicInformation`; `NtQueryInformationProcess` answers
`ProcessBasicInformation` and `ProcessDebugPort`. Every other class is refused with a status rather
than filled with plausible invented numbers. That is deliberate and should stay the rule: a refusal
is a message, a fabricated structure is a wrong answer that propagates.

### A8. There is one user and it is called "User"

`GetUserNameA` answers a constant. There is one account and no way to become another, so this is not
configuration. It exists at all because a program that cannot learn its own user name sometimes
refuses to start.

### A9. Thirty-two interrupt vectors, not two hundred and fifty-six

The boot ROM installs gates for the processor's own exception vectors and no others. A build with a
full table was tried and reverted: a vector fires during protected-mode entry and lands in a halting
stub, which reads as a hang — worse than a loud refusal.

### A10. Nothing here has run against a real GPU or a real guest

The whole drawing path — the DirectDraw blitter, the presenter, the Direct3D 8 draw path, the
device-context seam onto GDI — is verified by unit and contract tests only. In particular the
presenter's texture usage flags are inferred from what the existing composition path needs. A real
device is the only check of that, and until one runs, every graphics number in this repository is a
statement about our own model rather than about a picture.

## B. Where we could go faster

### B1. The x87 helpers, emitted as guest code

`floor`, `ceil`, `fabs`, `sqrt` and the float-to-long conversion currently cross the boundary into a
host handler. Emitting them as real x86 in guest memory means a program calling `floor` in a tight
loop pays for the arithmetic rather than for the crossing, which for a title that calls it tens of
thousands of times a frame is the whole cost. This needs the non-preemptible rounding-mode window
from `10-carried-knowledge.md`, and it is the single largest known win of this kind.

### B2. The floating-point seam builds a view per call

`layers/cpu/internal/fpu.js` takes a fresh `DataView` over the emulator's memory on every access,
because the memory can be grown and replaced underneath. Caching it against the current buffer
identity and rebuilding only when that changes removes an allocation from the hot path of every
maths function that returns a double.

### B3. The presenter uploads the whole primary

A blit into the visible surface causes the full surface to be read out of guest memory, converted
and uploaded. The buffer machinery already tracks the union of dirty ranges and uploads only that;
the same idea applies here, and the rectangle is known — every blit and every lock names one.

### B4. Nearest-palette-index search is a linear scan

Writing to an eight-bit surface through GDI searches all 256 palette entries for the closest colour.
It is cached per colour, so a fill pays once, but a gradient or a converted image pays repeatedly. A
coarse lookup table indexed by the top bits of each channel makes it a constant-time read.

### B5. A just-in-time compiler, an ahead-of-time cache, and a differential oracle

The predecessor tree carries a substantial body of work on all three. It was read only at the level
of its commit messages and is deliberately not carried yet: nothing here is fast enough for it to be
the bottleneck. Worth a second pass when something is.

### B6. Guest thread latency, not throughput

Recorded here because it decides which of the above is worth doing first: the cost that matters most
in this engine is how long a guest thread is held, not how much total work gets done. An
optimisation that improves throughput while lengthening a single hold is a regression.
